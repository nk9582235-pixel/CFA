But the concentration ratio may not change much. To avoid the known issues with concentration ratios, economists O.C. Herfindahl and A.O.

ML techniques are being used for Big Data analysis to help predict trends or market events, such as the likelihood of a successful merger or an outcome to a political election. Image recognition algorithms can now analyze data from satellite-imaging systems to provide intelligence on the number of consumers in retail store parking lots, shipping activity and manufacturing facilities, and yields on agricultural crops, to name just a few examples. Such information may provide insights into individual firms or at national or global levels and may be used as inputs into valuation or economic models.\u0026nbsp;Thus, there is rather broad application of ML in Big Data analysis, which is expected to develop further.\u003c/p\u003e"

Market participants would then come to the view that higher interest rates will lead to slower economic growth, reduced profits, and reduced borrowing to finance asset purchases. Weaker total demand would tend to put downward pressure on the rate of domestic inflation as would a stronger currency, which would reduce the prices of imports. Taken together, these might begin to put downward pressure on the overall measure of inflation.\u0026nbsp;Consequently, a change in the central bank's interest rate does not get transmitted through the economy via inflation, as the latter is the end result and not a transmission channel.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/p\u003e"

Compensation dominated by stock grants and options can motivate excessive management risk-taking, as option holders participate only in upside share price moves. Similarly, little or no use of stock grants and options in compensation plans can lead to unduly risk-averse corporate decision-making and the inability to attract talent. This misalignment may be at odds with the company’s value creation objective or shareholders’ desire for higher-risk, higher-reward endeavors. Since investors can hold diversified portfolios, they may have a higher risk tolerance than managers, whose reputation and time are concentrated in a single company.\u0026nbsp;In other words, when\u0026nbsp;risky projects that match shareholders' risk tolerance are pursued by the company, there is no conflict\u0026nbsp;of interest between shareholders and management.\u003c/p\u003e"
