Losses are realized by the subordinated bond classes before any losses are realized by the senior Class A bonds. A is incorrect because this senior/subordinated structure is an example of credit tranching, not time tranching. C is incorrect because in a waterfall structure such as this one, the most junior tranche, Class D, will absorb all losses up to its full CAD50 million par value first. Then, if credit losses exceed that threshold, Bond Class C will absorb all losses up to its full CAD100 million par value. The losses are not shared proportionally across all subordinated bond classes; instead, they are absorbed by the most junior classes first and subsequently by the more senior ones up to the value of the loss.\u003c/p\u003e\n            "

Structural call protection is achieved through sequential-pay tranches in the CMBS as a lower-rated tranche cannot be paid down until the higher-rated tranche is completely retired. A is incorrect because defeasance provides call protection at the individual loan level. Defeasance allows prepayment, but the borrower must purchase a portfolio of government securities that fully replicates the cash flows of the remaining scheduled principal and interest payments, including the balloon loan balance, on the loan. B is incorrect because prepayment lockout provides call protection at the individual loan level. Prepayment lockout is a contractual agreement that prohibits any prepayments during a specified period.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "
