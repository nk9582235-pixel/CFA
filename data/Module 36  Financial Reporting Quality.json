Another example of how choices and estimates can affect reported results lies in the selection of a depreciation method for allocating the cost of long-lived assets to accounting periods subsequent to their acquisition. A company’s managers may choose to depreciate long-lived assets (1) on a straight-line basis, with each year bearing the same amount of depreciation expense; (2) using an accelerated method, with greater depreciation expense recognition in the earlier part of an asset’s life; or (3) using an activity-based depreciation method, which allocates depreciation expense based on units of use or production.\u003c/p\u003e",

In an environment of declining inventory unit costs and constant or increasing inventory quantities, FIFO (in comparison with weighted average cost or LIFO) will allocate a higher amount of the total cost of goods available for sale to cost of sales on the income statement and a lower amount to ending inventory on the balance sheet. Accordingly, because cost of sales will be higher under FIFO, a company’s gross profit, operating profit, and income before taxes will be lower. Assumptions about inventory cost flows provide another example of how accounting choices can affect financial reporting.\u003c/p\u003e"

Classifying a purchase as an expense, rather than capital expenditure, would decrease earnings in the reporting period.
