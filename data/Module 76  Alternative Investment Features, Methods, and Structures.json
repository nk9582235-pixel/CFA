In addition to limited partnership agreements (LPAs), a supplemental document known as a side letter also may be negotiated. Side letters are agreements between the general partner and one or more limited partners that exist outside the LPA and whose terms override or modify the original limited partnership agreement terms. A side letter is negotiated to address the unique legal, regulatory, or reporting requirements of a specific investor. B is incorrect because an excusal right gives an investor the right to forgo a capital contribution or to not participate in a particular type of investment. An excusal right is granted when it has been stipulated in a side letter, not independently. C is incorrect because the limited partnership agreement establishes and governs the terms of a limited partnership; its terms apply to all limited partners, not just to a specific investor who requires tailored terms.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

Private equity funds typically calculate their management fee based on committed capital, which is the total amount that the limited partners have promised to fund future investments, rather than based on assets under management. The committed-capital basis for management fees is an important distinction from hedge funds, whose management fees are typically based on assets under management. Having committed capital as the basis for management fee calculations reduces the incentive for GPs to deploy the committed capital as quickly as possible to grow their fee base and thus allows the GPs to be selective about deploying capital into investment opportunities. B is incorrect because alternative investment funds usually combine a management fee with a performance fee paid when fund returns exceed a specified hurdle rate. Although this combined fee approach is typical for alternative investment funds, it is not what encourages managers to invest selectively, rather than quickly. C is incorrect because typically hedge funds and REITs charge a management fee on assets under management, while private equity funds instead levy management fees on committed capital.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

A clawback provision grants limited partners the right to reclaim a portion of the general partner’s performance fee. Clawback provisions are usually activated when a GP exits successful deals early on but incurs losses on deals later in the fund’s life. A is incorrect because a catch-up clause allows a general partner to accelerate performance fees once a fund exceeds a specified soft hurdle rate. B is incorrect because the high-water mark identifies the fund’s peak value as of a performance calculation date net of fees; it is not a performance fee modification.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

Direct investing offers investors maximum flexibility and control when it comes to investment choice, methods of financing, and timing.
