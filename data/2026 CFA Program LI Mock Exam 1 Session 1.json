However, simply because the public in general would find the conclusions material does not require that Campbell\u0026nbsp;make her work public. Campbell\u0026nbsp;is not a company insider and does not have access to inside information.\u0026nbsp;Further, according to Standard II (A), the source or relative reliability of the information also determines materiality. The less reliable a source, the less likely the information provided would be considered material. For example, information about trials of a new drug, product, or service under development from qualified personnel involved in the trials is likely to be material, whereas educated conjecture by subject experts not connected to the trials is unlikely to be material. In this case, information gathered from automobile experts not connected to XLK about the commercial viability of XLK's project is not material. Therefore, Campbell has not violated Standard II (A) either by using information that is not yet public or by failing to make her recommendation public.\u0026nbsp;\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

At the end of the last quarter, Quanta’s firm, North Investment Bank, held a large position in the bonds of Veyron Corporation, a real estate company with all of its land holdings in a country recently downgraded by several credit rating agencies. The downgrades made Veyron bonds extremely difficult to sell because the bond price has dropped every day since the downgrades. Quanta has been asked by his supervisor to contact the firm’s institutional clients to convince them Veyron bonds are still an attractive purchase, especially at these lower prices.
