For example, debtholders with a fixed claim tend to be risk averse and prefer that the corporation take actions to ensure sufficient cash flow to meet its debt obligations. For this reason, debtholders tend to prefer that a company raise more equity and limit shareholder distributions. Shareholders, however, tend to prefer greater leverage and shareholder distributions rather than dilutive equity issuance.\u0026nbsp;This potential conflict is greater for long-term debt, as the passage of time exposes debtholders to changes in business conditions, strategy, and management behavior. As a result, long-term creditors are more likely to impose contractual limits on leverage and shareholder distributions.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

While management compensation seeks to motivate managers to maximize shareholder value, manager and shareholder interests may diverge regarding\u0026nbsp;inappropriate risk appetite. Compensation dominated by stock grants and options can motivate excessive management risk-taking, as option holders participate only in upside share price moves. Similarly, little or no use of stock grants and options in compensation plans can lead to unduly risk-averse corporate decision-making and the inability to attract talent. This misalignment may be at odds with the company’s value creation objective or shareholders’ desire for higher-risk, higher-reward endeavors. Since investors can hold diversified portfolios, they may have a higher risk tolerance than managers, whose reputation and time are concentrated in a single company.\u0026nbsp;Therefore, good corporate governance seeks to align interests of managers and shareholders through effective compensation to avoid excessive or too little risk-taking that is not aligned with shareholder interests.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

Companies are increasingly designing incentive plans that discourage “short-termism” or excessive risk-taking by managers. Some incentive plans include granting shares, rather than options, to managers and restricting their vesting or sale for several years or until retirement. A long-term incentive plan delays compensation, either in part or in total, until a company’s strategic objectives (typically performance targets) are met.\u0026nbsp;Therefore, good corporate governance combats short-termism through long-term incentive plans.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/p\u003e"

The report also emphasized that the company had “a culture that prioritized winning purchase orders and meeting delivery deadlines over ensuring quality.”\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eThe company committed to implementing various measures to prevent a recurrence of the misconduct.
