The finance lease accounting model is identical to the lessee accounting model for IFRS. The operating lease accounting model is different. The key difference between an operating lease and a finance lease is how the amortization of the ROU asset is calculated.

Under IFRS, there is a single accounting model for both finance and operating leases for lessees.

A company’s suppliers are typically short-term creditors who have a primary interest in being paid as contracted in a timely manner for products or services delivered to the company. The conflict between shareholders and creditors, or debtholders, reflects their different positions in the capital structure and the different structure of risks and returns for each. Debtholders have a contractual and prior claim to cash flows and firm assets over shareholders.\u0026nbsp;For a holder of debt to maturity,\u0026nbsp;the return or upside is prescribed and limited, while the risk, or downside, is not. In other words, the risk–return profile for debtholders is very asymmetric.
