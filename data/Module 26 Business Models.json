HealthyPet targets the high-income, young, urban, busy professional pet owner segment. It bundles coverage for owners of multiple pets, including exotic pets that incumbents are typically reluctant to insure. The industry incumbents sell insurance policies that reimburse pet owners for a percentage of veterinarian and other medical costs incurred, subject to restrictions and limits. HealthyPet, however, pays veterinarians directly for pet medical costs. It has a preferred network of veterinarians it recommends and for which it negotiates lower prices, but policyholders face relatively few restrictions. It sells through veterinarian referrals and boutique pet stores to maintain an image of exclusivity and prestige and maintains an online storefront for customer convenience. It avoids mass market retail to protect its image. It charges more than its competitors for monthly insurance premiums because it is a better product. The pricing has worked so far because HealthyPet has a strong brand and a distinctiveness that its customers value.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eDiaSera designs, makes, and sells a medical device that delivers insulin to people with insulin-dependent diabetes known as an insulin pump. DiaSera’s pump is differentiated from those of its competitors in its design and operation; it is far smaller and more aesthetically pleasing than competitors’ pumps. It is a single, small device adhered to a user’s skin, while competitors’ pumps consist of separate handheld controllers attached to a delivery device on a user’s skin with tubing.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eInsulin pumps are used primarily by people with Type 1 diabetes, which is a smaller market that has complex medical needs, including close management of insulin. The insulin pump market is complex, with several competitors; complement products, such as insulin monitoring devices; and an inexpensive substitute: using multiple daily injections of insulin.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eDiaSera is looking to expand its customer reach to include Type 2 diabetics who are on multiple daily insulin injections, which is a market several times the size of the Type 1 diabetics market. DiaSera’s pump product is priced at a small premium to competitors. Management says that given significant economies of scale in manufacturing, unit costs will fall substantially as the customer base grows and, even with unchanged pricing, margins will rise significantly. Besides the differentiated product design, the company also offers substantial customer service from highly trained nurses both before and after the sale. Access to customer service is available 24/7 and does not have any additional cost to the customer.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eDiaSera makes direct sales to customers and markets to both customers and physicians, because customers must receive a prescription for the pump from a physician before purchase. Products are shipped directly to customers’ homes.\u003c/p\u003e",

It is not clear that their offering is sufficiently differentiated to build a large-enough customer base to provide the diversification that an insurance company depends on (insurance requires a large pool of policyholders such that there is enough premiums to cover losses). It may incur an adverse selection problem in covering exotic pets because they may be uneconomical to insure as evidenced by the reluctance of established companies to insure them. Finally, if its model is successful, it will likely face competition in the form of imitators, possibly from the incumbent insurers because it is probably possible for them to copy the model of pay veterinarians directly.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eHealthyPet could see opportunity in building a loyal base of customers and a loyal base of veterinarians.

It is priced only slightly higher than parity with competitors but aims to provide substantially better customer service by using highly trained experts. If customer growth and sales disappoint or take longer than expected, the economies of scale in manufacturing will as well, potentially imperiling profitability or forcing management to raise prices. A second major risk is targeting Type 2 diabetics who have historically not used insulin pumps. While DiaSera’s insulin pump seems more convenient than multiple daily injections of insulin, it is more expensive and requires customers to navigate a potentially complicated prescription, purchasing, and service scenario. DiaSera management should discuss key factors that give it confidence in the strategy—such as a segment of customers in the Type 2 market who have tried a pump before, patients who are younger and more likely to try a new product—and establish relationships with key physicians who can recommend the product to patients.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eThe clear major opportunities are market share gains in Type 1 diabetes from inferior competitor products and the new market opportunity of Type 2 diabetics who require multiple daily injections. If competitors have not segmented the market to explicitly target this cohort, DiaSera could realize a competitive advantage.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eKey questions include details on its manufacturing strategy, such as estimating unit costs or gross margins at different levels of volume, how experienced the manufacturing management and staff are in this setting, to what extent the company owns the manufacturing resources, and whether there are key suppliers it relies on. Additionally, an analyst will have to develop an outlook for market penetration and sales based on customer segmenting, historical data, precedent product launches, and realistic expectations for customer demand at the current price point. Finally, additional details on how many service professionals are needed per number of customers and at what cost will be essential to modeling operating costs.\u003c/p\u003e\n            "
