Securitization provides a direct conduit between borrowers and investors. It also allows investors to tailor interest rate and credit risk exposures to suit their specific risk, return, and maturity needs. A is incorrect because securitization creates efficiency for issuers and financial markets more directly than for investors. Securitization allows issuers to sell illiquid assets and operate more efficiently on a risk-adjusted basis. Moreover, because securitization creates tradable securities with higher liquidity than the original underlying assets, it makes financial markets more efficient. B is incorrect because securitization improves overall liquidity in the financial system and reduces liquidity risk, which benefits participants in financial markets.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

In order for these assets (leases) to be securitized, they must be held in a separate legal entity structure distinct from AR\u0026amp;C. The separate legal entity structure ensures that if AR\u0026amp;C, the originator of the leases, files for bankruptcy, the leases backing the ABS that are issued by the separate legal entity are secure there, thus AR\u0026amp;C’s creditors cannot have any claim on them. A is incorrect because if AR\u0026amp;C issues the securities, the leases remain on AR\u0026amp;C’s balance sheet and thus could still be accessible to AR\u0026amp;C’s creditors in the event of a bankruptcy. C is incorrect because servicing the leases must continue whether or not by AR\u0026amp;C or another entity, but servicing the leases is separate from securitizing them.\u003c/p\u003e\n            "
