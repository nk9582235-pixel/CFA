The limited partners of DAG LP are not shareholders of DAG Inc., so they do not have voting rights in the corporation. Additionally, because the limited partners own only 20% of the partnership, they also have little ability to remove DAG Inc. as the general partner. In contrast, outside shareholders own 70% of DAG Inc. and have voting rights. They could use their collective ownership to effect change in the management of DAG Inc.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eA is incorrect.

The Dee family can effectively control management of the timber and forest assets with only a 24% effective ownership stake in the partnership.
