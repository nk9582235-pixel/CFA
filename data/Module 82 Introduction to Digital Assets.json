Under both PoW and PoS consensus protocols, the validation of the transactions, or “mining,” always comes with rewards. A successful miner that validates the transactions obtains new digital assets—either a cryptocurrency or a token. For blockchain networks based on the PoW protocol, the miner earns his digital assets by solving complex algorithm puzzles to validate blocks of transactions onto a blockchain network. For blockchain networks based on the PoS protocol, the miner earns his digital assets by staking his own to validate and attest to the new blocks of transactions.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

Decentralized exchanges operate on a distributed platform without central coordination or control. The benefit is that should one of the computers on the network be attacked, the exchange remains operational since there are numerous other computers that continue to operate on the network. For this reason, decentralized exchanges are substantially more difficult to hack, rendering such attacks almost certain to fail. However, transactions on centralized cryptocurrency exchanges are hosted on private servers, exposing the centralized exchanges and their clients to security vulnerabilities. Should the exchange’s servers become compromised, the entire system may become paralyzed, halting trade and leaking vital user information, such as cryptographic keys stored in the cryptocurrency wallets.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

Investing in a cryptocurrency coin trust that holds Bitcoins is the best way to replicate the return on Bitcoins. Investing in a listed cryptocurrency exchange stock provides very indirect exposure that may not necessarily replicate the performance of Bitcoins because of a variety of company-specific factors, as well as the sensitivity to the general stock market environment. Buying Bitcoins from a centralized cryptocurrency exchange provides a direct exposure, but it would require a digital wallet.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "
