There are numerous types of share-based compensation programs; some result in the issuance of shares to employees, and others result in a cash payment based on the value of company shares. Answer A is not correct because even if no cash is exchanged at the time of grant, the compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of the grant. Answer C is not correct because, in some cases, employees may not receive the benefit of a stock option. For example, if the stock option expires when the exercise price exceeds the market value of the company’s stock, the recipient may not benefit from the grant.\u003c/p\u003e"

Lessor accounting for an operating lease under US GAAP is similar to that under IFRS: Over the lease term, the lessor recognizes lease receipts as income and recognizes related costs, including depreciation of the leased asset, as expenses. Under IFRS, at inception of a finance lease—not an operating lease—the lessor derecognizes the underlying leased asset and recognizes a lease asset comprising the lease receivable and relevant residual value. Further, an IFRS-reporting lessor will recognize selling profit at the beginning of all leases that are not classified as operating leases. In contrast, a US GAAP–reporting lessor will recognize selling profit only on sales-type leases at the beginning of the lease term.\u003c/p\u003e"

A company that offers a defined benefit plan makes payments into a pension fund and the retirees are paid from the fund. The payments that a company makes into the fund are invested until they are needed to pay retirees. If the fair value of the fund’s assets is higher than the present value of the estimated pension obligation, the plan has a surplus and the company’s balance sheet will reflect a net pension asset. Because the fair value of the fund’s assets is USD1,500,000,000 and the present value of estimated pension obligations is USD1,200,000,000, the company will present a net pension asset of USD300,000,000 on its balance sheet.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "
