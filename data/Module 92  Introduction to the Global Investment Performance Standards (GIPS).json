A composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. For example, if a GIPS-compliant firm presents performance for a global equity composite (the composite), the composite must include portfolios that are managed, or have historically been managed, according to the firm’s global equity strategy. A is incorrect because a composite is an aggregation of one or more portfolios managed according to a similar investment mandate, objective, or strategy. A composite may consist of a single portfolio when it is the only portfolio managed according to a particular investment mandate.
