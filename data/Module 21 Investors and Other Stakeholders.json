Managers, overseen by the board of directors, serve as agents who should act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders. However, in some cases, managers may put their own interests ahead of shareholders’ interests. Examples include insufficient effort, excessive perquisite consumption (e.g., corporate jets, elaborate offices), and failure to take appropriate risks or make investments in an effort to safeguard their jobs. Oversight by a majority independent board and compensation to align managers’ interests with shareholders’, such as performance-based and equity-based compensation schemes, are mechanisms to mitigate these conflicts of interest.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "
