The main appeal of the REIT structure is the elimination of double corporate taxation. Corporations pay taxes on their income, from which they make dividend distributions to their owners from after-tax earnings. The shareholders, in turn, are taxed at their personal tax rate. Equity REITs, like other public companies, must report earnings per share based on net income as defined by generally accepted accounting principles or International Financial Reporting Standards.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

Real estate has historically low correlations with other asset classes, and adding real estate to an investment portfolio provides diversification benefits at relatively lower levels of risk. Many commercial real estate companies offer multiple-year leases with fixed rents; hence, the income earned from these leases is typically both predictable and stable. Moreover, real estate tends to provide inflation protection because the lease payments are regularly adjusted.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "
