Through the process of greater economic and financial cooperation, companies may become dependent on other countries’ resources for their supply chains.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for certain essential supply chains to be rebuilt domestically for emergency situations, with availability of critical spare parts being an analogy.

Cabotage is the right to transport passengers or goods within a country by a foreign firm. Many countries—including those with multilateral trade agreements—impose restrictions on cabotage across transportation subsectors, meaning that shippers, airlines, and truck drivers are not allowed to transport goods and services within another country’s borders. Allowing cabotage requires coordination on areas like physical security and economic coordination, a highly multilateral (multifaceted tool) process. B is incorrect because armed conflict is the most extreme example of a national security tool. It can be either internal or external to a country in taking a direct and active approach to wielding influence. C is incorrect because nationalization of key export industries is an economic tool.
