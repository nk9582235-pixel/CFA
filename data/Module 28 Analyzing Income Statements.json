In addition, it is possible that some potentially convertible securities are antidilutive (i.e., their inclusion in the computation would result in an EPS higher than the company's basic EPS). Under IFRS and US GAAP, antidilutive securities are not included in the calculation of diluted EPS. Basic EPS = (Net income – Preferred dividends) / Weighted average number of shares outstanding = ($1,250,000 – $120,000) / 500,000 = $2.26.

LB has warrants in its capital structure; if the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price during the year, the effect of their conversion is to increase the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, causing diluted EPS to be lower than basic EPS. If the exercise price is equal to the weighted average market price, the number of shares issued equals the number of shares repurchased. Therefore, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is not affected and diluted EPS equals basic EPS. If the exercise price is greater than the weighted average market price, the effect of their conversion is anti-dilutive. As such, they are not included in the calculation of basic EPS. LB’s basic EPS is USD1.22 [= (USD3,350,000 – USD430,000)/2,400,000]. Stock dividends are treated as having been issued retroactively to the beginning of the period.\u003c/p\u003e",

When a company has stock options outstanding, diluted EPS is calculated as if the financial instruments had been exercised and the company had used the proceeds from the exercise to repurchase as many shares possible at the weighted average market price of common stock during the period.

The conversion of convertible debt increases the net income available to common shareholders by the after-tax amount of interest expense saved.
