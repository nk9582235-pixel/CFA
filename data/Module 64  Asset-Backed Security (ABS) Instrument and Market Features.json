Triggering rapid amortization provisions accelerates and alters principal cash flows. Noteholders will receive their investments earlier, which they can then reallocate to other investments offering more attractive risk/return characteristics. A is incorrect because typically during the revolving period, as credit cards are non-amortizing loans, the security holders receive only payments from the finance charges and fees the lender collects.

Investors in equity tranches take on equity-like risks with the potential to earn returns comparable to equities. Moreover, these residual tranche investors play a key role in whether a CLO is viable or not; the CLO structure has to offer competitive returns for this tranche. Facing these risk/return possibilities puts them in the position of the marginal, price-setting investors. A and C are incorrect because they are promised fixed returns without reference to the underlying performance of the collateral pool. They are also exposed to less risk in having seniority payoff preference in case of default.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

A complicating factor of a default can be the call features embedded in bonds. While exercising call options on debt would replenish the collateral pool, distributing these proceeds to the senior and mezzanine tranches would shrink the size of the collateral pool, further narrowing the earnings potential with junior tranches receiving the least cash flow. A is incorrect because senior tranches are then in danger of not receiving some or any payments, depending on the size of the default. C is incorrect because losses would first be absorbed by junior tranche investors, with remaining losses realized by the other tranches in order of repayment seniority.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

As illustrated by their respective term sheets, all three types of ABS transactions have timing milestones designating due dates for investments (settlement date) and the end of their terms (maturity date).
