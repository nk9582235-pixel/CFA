A 75-day timing difference exists between the commercial contract date and the delivery date when Montau AG is paid for the machine in KRW. A is true but does not explain why the use of a derivative is preferable to a spot market transaction. If as in C Montau were to sell the KRW it receives and buy EUR in a spot market transaction on the delivery date, it would be exposed to unfavorable changes in the KRW/EUR exchange rate over the 75-day period. A derivative contract in which the underlying KRW/EUR forward rate is agreed today and exchanged on the delivery date allows Montau to hedge or offset the EUR value of the future KRW payment. The derivative is therefore a more suitable contract to address the financial risk of the commercial transaction than a spot market sale of KRW.\u003c/p\u003e",
