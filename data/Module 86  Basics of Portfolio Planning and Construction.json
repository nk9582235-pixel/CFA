Risk budgeting implies that the portfolio manager has to choose, for every asset class, whether to deploy security selection as a return generator.

As stated in the reading, “One principle is that a portfolio’s systematic risk accounts for most of its change in value over the long run.” A second principle is that, “the returns to groups of like assets… predictably reflect exposures to certain sets of systematic factors.” This latter principle establishes that returns on asset classes primarily reflect the systematic risks of the classes.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "
