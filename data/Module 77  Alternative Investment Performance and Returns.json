The hurdle rate is a \u003ci\u003eminimum \u003c/i\u003erate of return, typically 8%, that the GP must exceed in order to earn the performance fee. GPs typically receive 20% of the total profit of the private equity fund net of any \u003ci\u003ehard hurdle rate\u003c/i\u003e, in which case the GP earns fees on annual returns in excess of the hurdle rate, or net of the \u003ci\u003esoft hurdle rate\u003c/i\u003e, in which case the fee is calculated on the entire annual gross return as long as the set hurdle is exceeded.

Although the gross return of Rotunda results in a $360 million gross NAV, the deduction of the $7.2 million management fee brings NAV to $352.8 million, which is below the prior high-water mark. Rotunda earns a management fee of $7.20 million but does not earn an incentive fee because the year-end fund value net of management fee does not exceed the prior high-water mark of $357 million. Since Rotunda is still also below the prior-year high-water mark, the hurdle rate of return is also basically irrelevant in this fee calculation.\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eThe specifics of this calculation are as follows:\u003c/p\u003e\n            \u003cul id=\"CFA2456-R-s03-L5\" style=\"list-style-type: none; margin-bottom: 15px; padding-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n               \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px; position: relative;\"\u003e\n                  \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eEnd-of-year AUM = Prior year-end AUM × (1 + Fund return) = $288 million × 1.25 = $360 million.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003c/li\u003e\n               \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px; position: relative;\"\u003e\n                  \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003e$360 million × 2% = $7.20 million management fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003c/li\u003e\n               \u003cli style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px; position: relative;\"\u003e\n                  \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003e$360 million − $7.2 million = $352.8 million AUM net of management fee.\u003c/p\u003e\n               \u003c/li\u003e\n            \u003c/ul\u003e\n            \u003cp style=\"margin-top: 0.75rem; margin-bottom: 0.75rem;\"\u003eThe year-end AUM net of fees do not exceed the $357 million high-water mark.

Accounting rules require that investments be recorded at their fair value for financial reporting purposes. The fair value of private equity that owns illiquid assets requires certain estimates, rather than observable transaction prices, to be factored into valuation. A model that relies on Level 3 inputs may reflect an imperfect theoretical valuation and not a true liquidation value. The lack of new market information over time may anchor the interim valuation at or near initial cost. The relatively stable accounting valuations may give investors a false sense that they are less volatile. At the same time, there is a potential conflict of interest for the GP to overstate interim return because of the implication for carried interest. As a result, returns may be smoothed or overstated and the volatility of returns understated.\u003c/p\u003e\n         "

Investment 3 does not earn the GP any carry because it fails to meet the preferred return; neither does Investment 5, whose profit is negative. Because of the clawback clause, the GP’s carry is reduced by $2 million (or 20% of the loss on Investment 5).
