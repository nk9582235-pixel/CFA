The purpose of time tranching is the redistribution of payments based on the timing of prepayments, regardless of the credit profile. The structure of a securitization may also allow the redistribution of another type of risk, called ‘prepayment risk’ among bond classes. Prepayment risk is the uncertainty that the cash flows will be different from the scheduled cash flows as set forth in the loan agreement because of the borrowers’ ability to alter payments, usually to take advantage of interest rate movements.
