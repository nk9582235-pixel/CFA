If the market reference rate increases, they are paying more and the value of the contract decreases to them. Another interpretation of an interest rate swap is that the fixed-rate payer (floating-rate receiver) is long a floating-rate note (FRN) priced at the MRR and short a fixed-rate bond with a coupon equal to the fixed swap rate. Similarly, the fixed-rate receiver (floating-rate payer) is long a fixed-rate bond with a coupon equal to the swap rate and short a floating-rate note priced at the MRR. A rise in the expected forward rates after inception will increase the present value of floating payments, while the fixed-swap rate will remain the same.\u003c/p\u003e",
